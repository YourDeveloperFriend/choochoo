        <p>Same as base game with the following changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The color of the six unnumbered border cities is randomly determined during setup. Cubes can never pass
                through these cities (only end there).</li>
            <li>Engineer only allows 3 builds, but the cost of one track tile placement (the most expensive) is halved
                (rounded up).</li>
            <li>You cannot have any incomplete track at the end of your build action.</li>
            <li>Berlin (the unnumbered black city in the center) always receives one cube during Goods Growth.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
