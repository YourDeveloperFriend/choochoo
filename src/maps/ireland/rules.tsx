    <p>Same as base game with the following changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Brown hexes:</b> start with a fixed number of goods and won't get any more for the rest of the game. They don't accept goods but still act as stops.</li>
      <li><b>Less cities:</b> the game has four less cities and no urbanization action.</li>
      <li><b>Shorter:</b> The game has one less turn than the base game.</li>
      <li><b>Sea routes:</b> are pre-built track that can be claimed for $6/each. It counts as one of your builds, and can only be done once per turn.</li>
      <li><b>Unpassable edges:</b> cannot build through edges of some hexes in the map.</li>
      <li><b>Multiple color cities:</b> accept goods of multiple colors.</li>
      <li><b>Deurbanization:</b> lets you remove any cube from the board just before the move goods action.</li>
      <li><b>Locomotive:</b> only temporarily gives you a +1, does not increase your expenses and reverts at the end of the round.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>;
