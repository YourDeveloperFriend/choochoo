      <p>Same as base game with the following changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Production Action:</b> lets you place two white cubes in any town
          or city (the same or different ones). White cubes cannot be delivered,
          but aid in keeping with the next rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Moving goods:</b> you will need to drop off a cube at every stop
          along your move goods action, using cubes from the originating city.
          For example, if you move a good three steps, then you will need to
          take two additional cubes from the home location, and drop one off at
          each intervening stop. You cannot make a delivery if you cannot meet
          this requirement. The color of the intermediate cubes is irrelevant.
          ChooChoo note: make your delivery first, then you will be asked to
          choose which goods are dropped off along the way.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>National Airport: </b>receives all goods from the dark side of the
          goods growth table, in addition to the white 1 (this is not
          rendered).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Game Length:</b> 9 turns for 3 players, 8 turns for 2 players.
        </li>
